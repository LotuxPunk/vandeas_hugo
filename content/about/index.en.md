Hi there!

Iâ€™m ClÃ©ment, a programmer currently working at iCure. My passion for programming was ignited by the video game Minecraft and has since expanded to include a variety of exciting projects. These include developing an ERP for cinemas and creating several websites and mobile apps. In April 2023, I took my passion to the next level and started my own side business.

Check out my projects to see some of my work! ðŸš€
